This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- Read the comments within the home page.tsx and do as they say.
- Update the meta "<title>" tag to read "NIC GDES 255 Final" instead of "Create Next App".
- Update the meta description with the goal you are going to strive for to be ready for next years html/css/js class.
- The about page needs to have quick description of the things you learned this year. In the same format as the completed homepage.

Once done with the tasks above create a merge request with the gdes-255-final repo.

For extra credit... Deploy to Vercel.
